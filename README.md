# Holy Voice of God
Kneel before thine Savior and praise be unto Him. For he shall reveal Holy truths to thine humble servant. And it was 
good.

## How it works

The Bible possesses holy hidden frequencies that reveal fundamental truths about your binary data. Holy Voice of God
 encodes your data in subtle shifts in Bible passages and reveals the Truth within your bits. Any arbitrary bitstream
 can be encoded and uniquely decoded using Holy Voice of God.  
 
 Forget base64 or other unanointed text-based encodings. Embrace the Holy Voice of God.
